# Generic Quiz'

#### The main goal of the Generic Quiz is to test the public general knowledge on movies. My goal is to create a website that is fun and a little challenging for the user to test there knowledge on movies.

### Hopes for the website.
My main goal for the website is for the user to have a unique experience going through the game. I hope to have a website where as the user progresses through the quiz there score gets tallied and at the end they have a total score for the quiz. I would like to have pictures throughout the quiz so the user gets a visual aid with the questions.
