# The Movie Quiz'

#### The main goal of The Movie Quiz is to test the public general knowledge on movies. My goal is to create a website that is fun and a little challenging for the user to test there knowledge of movies.

### Hopes for the website.
My main goal for the website is for the user to have a unique experience going through the game. I hope to have a website where as the user progresses through the quiz there score gets tallied and at the end they have a total score for the quiz. I would like to have pictures throughout the quiz so the user gets a visual aid with the questions.

## Bug Testing
Had an issue with JS where the quiz wasn't loading, but changing the order in which the code is fixed that issue. Learning from the previous project where my images failed since they were uploaded the way we were taught during the Love Running Project, I have used the URL of the picture instead of dragging the image from my desktop into the code editor.
<br>
Currently getting an issue where it wont connect to my JS file... Turns out i just forgot to put the JS file into the JS folder as the script directory was correct, but it was just missing the file...
