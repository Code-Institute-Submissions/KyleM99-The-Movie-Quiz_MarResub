# The Movie Quiz'

#### The main goal of The Movie Quiz is to test the public general knowledge on movies. My goal is to create a website that is fun and a little challenging for the user to test there knowledge of movies.

### Hopes for the website.
My main goal for the website is for the user to have a unique experience going through the game. I hope to have a website where as the user progresses through the quiz there score gets tallied and at the end they have a total score for the quiz. I would like to have pictures throughout the quiz so the user gets a visual aid with the questions.

## Bug Testing
Only issues I had were the website not taking the font I was using but grabbing the correct code needed for the font was the fix for that issue. Learning from the previous project where my images failed since they were uploaded the way we were taught during the Love Running Project, I have used the URL of the picture instead of dragging the image from my desktop into the code editor.

Quiz code- I did not fully write the JS behind the quiz code myself, however I also didn't just copy paste it and pass it off on my own. I took about an hour writing this code out with the website and getting a better understanding as to how things are written and in what way they are written also. The reason behind me taking this path is purely down to time and confidence after the JS LMS, I am not confident at all with the JS language, but in writing the quiz code step by step I definetely have a better understanding for the code that I have written. The website I got help with this quiz script was [Sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/simple-javascript-quiz/)
